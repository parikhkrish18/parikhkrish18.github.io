                                I learned how to creatively solve problems using algorithms and how databases 
                                are created for user- interfaces in different fields, such as medicine 
                                (patient-doctor) or business (client - employee). My responsibility was to 
                                assist my supervisor with ideas on how code could be compressed to simplify 
                                the code and make the programme more user-friendly. I was also supervised to 
                                test code and identify and solve bugs in coded programmes.

                                I volunteered for an NGO that aims to improve gender equality, specifically
                                in education, in India. I volunteered to assist in designing their website,
                                which indirectly helps them communicate effectively with their global 
                                audience. This did not involve any coding, but more the fundamentals about 
                                designing a website, specifically, how websites should and can be structured 
                                as a way of manipulating the viewer's attention towards specific sections or 
                                how to make a website user-friendly.

                                During this internship I familiarised myself with programming languages in 
                                web development, like JSON and HTML. In efforts to expand my knowledge beyond
                                    the dynamics of classical programming, I understood the process of 
                                    user-experience design. I ended my internship with a personalised weather 
                                    app I created from scratch.

                                This online course was the ideal way of professionally learning the 
                                fundamentals of computer science. I learned about bits, C libraries, 
                                memory and sorting methods through arrays, data structures and basics 
                                of SQL & python. This really benefitted me as over the course of the online 
                                lectures, we built up from the basics all the way to the complex structures 
                                of computer science. The projects given made me solve complex problems 
                                creatively and write code to solve abstract problems.

                                I coded an AI chatbot that can act as a counsellor to youth who are uncomfortable
                                to speak to a human therapist. I did this by first learning JSON and python code
                                and familiarising myself with user interfaces. I approached an expert in the 
                                computer science field to assist me with some of the initial coding. After 
                                programming the chatbot, I embedded it in a website that outlined my project and
                                further explained the issue of mental illness. The site was designed for a good
                                    user experience and created in a user-friendly manner. The aim of this project
                                    was to increase awareness of mental depression and demonstrate one of the ways
                                    on how problems in this field could be approached and solved creatively.
