                    Krish Parikh is a student at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Queen Mary University of London</a>. He is currently in his first year for a 4-year undergraduate degree in computer science. 
                    He was born and raised in Antwerpen, Belgium, and is of Indian descent.<br><br>

                    He is a self-motivated and creative student who has had a lifelong interest in technology, electronics, and the digital age. Krish is focused on achieving his goal of studying computer science and making a difference in the world. He has worked on projects and used a variety of online resources that can help him improve in this field. His long-term goal is to expand his knowledge and gain expertise in computer science, as well as to understand the evolution of technology and to be a part of it.<br><br>
                    "The developing nature of technology fascinates me", he says, "and I am keen on doing my part in advancing this. I learned about networks, webpages, and programming through online and personal mentors. Soon I realized that computer science being sole "programming and hacking" was a common misconception, while it is more about logical thinking, problem-solving, and storing information."
